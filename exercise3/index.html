<!--
    Create the basic web page layout. We are going too add
    an image. Implement the following:
    1. Implement the image 'still_free.jpg' inside an image tag
    2. Use the height and width attribute to give the image a
       width of 200 and a height of 300
    3. If the image looks funny, play around with the width and height
       until it looks correct.
    4. In an h1 tag above the image, give it a title. Any title you want is fine.
    5. In a paragraph tag, state what the image means for you, if anything.
